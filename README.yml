All Abilities, Max. Armor, Accessory, Item Slots and 50AP will be added right after the beginning of the Game.

All Keyblades will be added right after you have finished Roxas's Prolouge.

All Magic/Drive/Summon will be added right after you change clothes with Sora.




Q: Why not giving Keyblades and all other stuff also right at the beginning?

A: Roxas changes Keyblades between Events. If you Equip to early a different Keyblade, it will get lost. 
   Reduced to Atoms. Roxas MSET doesn't feature Magic usage Animations, Drives and other Abilities that Sora can use.
   Which means, He will either T-Pose or Crash.


Q: When do I actually unlock Summons/Limits?

A: Right after you set foot to Land of Dragons.


Q: What do I get instead of Keyblades and Magic, when I finish certain Events?

A: You simply get Power, Magic, Defense and AP Boost items. Final-Elixir for Chests and Summons.


Q: If I have all abilities and Magic, what do I get for Level Ups and Bonus Levels?

A: You simply get an Elixir for Bonuses and nothing except stats for Levelups.


Q: Do I still get the new Abilities by Leveling Drive Forms/Summons?

A: Yes, you do.


Q: Is this Re:Fined compatible?

A: Yes it is.


Q: Is it Randomizer compatible?

A: Don't be silly...


Q: Ultima can be smithed by Moogle, how works that now?

A: I replaced Ultima with "Edge of Ultima" Item-ID45. It uses W_EX010_Z0 as name for all Versions.
   So you can add it as a new Keyblade of your choice or leave it like that.


Q: Will it ever break because of another Update?

A: No, since i did NOT used a LUA Script.


Q: Which platforms are supported?

A: Steam and Epic
